One Day randomly i was searching in the web
I finded a website for send message into space it's name is (space speak) 

fasterly I created an account and
i sended several message into space.

then i researched about 
how to sended that messages to space?

in another day
i saw you can see sended message into space from other users

for this work you must search random a url like this

https://spacespeak.com/Users/28401/Messages

when you changed number from this url you can saw another user and then you can saw sended message from this user.


I found searchbox in the top menu of this web site and

i searched users with theire names i search diffrent names like a sara or michel and search persian names like Ali, Mina, Negar, Mosen and ...

i was curious about  know people what's message to send  into space ?
